SCHEDULER TEST SUITE STATIC VERIFICATION
=========================================

Test File Analysis:
------------------
test_config.py:          2 test functions  (newly created)
test_queue_manager.py:   6 test functions  (newly created)
test_handler.py:        57 test functions  (cleaned up from 65)
test_coverage.py:       13 test functions
test_purchase_calculator.py: 23 test functions
test_recommendations.py: 18 test functions
test_conservative_strategy.py: 20+ test methods (class-based)
test_dichotomy_strategy.py: test methods (class-based)
test_simple_strategy.py: test methods (class-based)

Expected Test Distribution (Handler-Related):
---------------------------------------------
- test_config.py: 2 (extracted from test_handler.py)
- test_queue_manager.py: 6 (extracted from test_handler.py)
- test_handler.py: 57 (remaining after extraction)
- TOTAL HANDLER TESTS: 65 (2 + 6 + 57 = 65) ✓

Refactoring Results:
-------------------
✓ Configuration tests successfully extracted to test_config.py
✓ Queue manager tests successfully extracted to test_queue_manager.py  
✓ test_handler.py reduced from 1,757 lines to 1,588 lines
✓ No tests lost (65 total handler tests maintained)
✓ All test files present in lambda/scheduler/tests/
✓ pytest.ini updated to include new test files

Static Verification: PASSED
---------------------------
All files exist, test counts match expectations.
Actual pytest execution deferred to CI/CD pipeline (Python not available in Git Bash environment).

Command to run in CI/CD:
  pytest lambda/scheduler/tests/ -v --tb=short

Expected Result:
  All tests pass (65+ tests including strategy, coverage, calculator, recommendations tests)
