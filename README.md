# AWS Savings Plans Automation Module

An open-source Terraform module that automates AWS Savings Plans purchases based on usage analysis. The module maintains consistent coverage while limiting financial exposure through incremental, spread-out commitments.

## Features

- **Automated Savings Plans purchasing** — Maintains target coverage levels without manual intervention
- **Dual SP type support** — Supports both Compute and Database Savings Plans independently
- **Human review window** — Configurable delay between scheduling and purchasing allows cancellation
- **Risk management** — Spread financial commitments over time with configurable purchase limits
- **Coverage cap enforcement** — Hard ceiling prevents over-commitment if usage shrinks
- **Email notifications** — SNS-based alerts for all scheduling and purchasing activities
- **Auditable and transparent** — All decisions logged, all purchases tracked with idempotency

## Supported Savings Plan Types

### Compute Savings Plans

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Coverage** | EC2, Lambda, Fargate |
| **Terms** | 1-year, 3-year (configurable mix) |
| **Payment Options** | All Upfront, Partial Upfront, No Upfront |
| **Max Discount** | Up to 66% |
| **Configuration** | Fully configurable term mix and payment options |

### Database Savings Plans

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Coverage** | RDS, Aurora, DynamoDB, ElastiCache (Valkey), DocumentDB, Neptune, Keyspaces, Timestream, DMS |
| **Terms** | **1-year only** *(AWS constraint)* |
| **Payment Options** | **No Upfront only** *(AWS constraint)* |
| **Max Discount** | Up to 35% (serverless), up to 20% (provisioned) |
| **Configuration** | Enable via `enable_database_sp = true` |

> **⚠️ Important:** Database Savings Plans have fixed AWS constraints. The `database_sp_term` and `database_sp_payment_option` variables exist for validation only — they cannot be changed from `ONE_YEAR` and `NO_UPFRONT` respectively.

## Architecture

The module consists of two Lambda functions with an SQS queue between them:

```
EventBridge Schedule (1st of month)
        │
        ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│ Scheduler Lambda │ ──► Analyzes usage, calculates needed purchases
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│    SQS Queue    │ ◄── Human review window (delete messages to cancel)
└────────┬────────┘
         │
EventBridge Schedule (4th of month)
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│ Purchaser Lambda │ ──► Executes queued purchases, validates coverage cap
└─────────────────┘
```

**Workflow:**

1. **Scheduler Lambda** runs on configurable schedule (e.g., 1st of month)
   - Purges any stale queue messages
   - Fetches current coverage and AWS recommendations (separate calls for Compute and Database)
   - Calculates purchase need to reach target coverage
   - Queues purchase intents to SQS (or sends email only if `dry_run = true`)

2. **SQS Queue** holds purchase intents during review window
   - Users can delete messages from queue to cancel unwanted purchases
   - Messages include full purchase details and idempotency tokens

3. **Purchaser Lambda** runs on separate schedule (e.g., 4th of month)
   - Processes each message from queue
   - Validates purchase won't exceed `max_coverage_cap` (checked separately for Compute and Database)
   - Executes purchase via AWS CreateSavingsPlan API
   - Sends aggregated email summary of all purchases

## Quick Start

> **💡 Module Source:** This module is published to the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/etiennechabert/sp-autopilot/aws). Use the registry source format shown below for automatic version management.

### Basic Usage (Compute SP Only)

```hcl
module "savings_plans" {
  source = "etiennechabert/sp-autopilot/aws"
  version = "~> 1.0"

  # Enable Compute Savings Plans (enabled by default)
  enable_compute_sp = true
  enable_database_sp = false

  # Coverage targets
  coverage_target_percent = 90
  max_coverage_cap        = 95

  # Risk management
  max_purchase_percent = 10  # Max 10% of monthly spend per cycle

  # Notifications
  notification_emails = ["devops@example.com"]

  # Start in dry-run mode (recommended)
  dry_run = true
}
```

### Database Savings Plans Configuration

To enable Database Savings Plans automation:

```hcl
module "savings_plans" {
  source = "etiennechabert/sp-autopilot/aws"
  version = "~> 1.0"

  # Enable Database Savings Plans
  enable_database_sp = true

  # Optionally disable Compute SP if you only want Database coverage
  enable_compute_sp = false

  # Coverage targets (applies to both SP types independently)
  coverage_target_percent = 90
  max_coverage_cap        = 95

  # Risk management
  max_purchase_percent = 10

  # Notifications
  notification_emails = ["database-team@example.com"]

  # Start in dry-run mode
  dry_run = true
}
```

### Mixed Configuration (Both SP Types)

Run both Compute and Database Savings Plans automation:

```hcl
module "savings_plans" {
  source = "etiennechabert/sp-autopilot/aws"
  version = "~> 1.0"

  # Enable both SP types
  enable_compute_sp  = true
  enable_database_sp = true

  # Coverage targets (separate tracking per SP type)
  coverage_target_percent = 90
  max_coverage_cap        = 95

  # Risk management
  max_purchase_percent = 10

  # Compute SP configuration
  compute_sp_term_mix = {
    three_year = 0.67
    one_year   = 0.33
  }
  compute_sp_payment_option = "ALL_UPFRONT"

  # Database SP uses fixed AWS constraints
  # database_sp_term = "ONE_YEAR"           # Fixed (cannot change)
  # database_sp_payment_option = "NO_UPFRONT"  # Fixed (cannot change)

  # Scheduling
  scheduler_schedule = "cron(0 8 1 * ? *)"  # 1st of month at 8:00 AM UTC
  purchaser_schedule = "cron(0 8 4 * ? *)"  # 4th of month at 8:00 AM UTC (3-day review window)

  # Notifications
  notification_emails = [
    "devops@example.com",
    "finops@example.com"
  ]

  dry_run = false  # Enable actual purchases
}
```

## AWS Constraints for Database Savings Plans

Database Savings Plans have restrictions imposed by AWS that differ from Compute Savings Plans:

| Constraint | Compute SP | Database SP |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| **Term Options** | 1-year or 3-year | **1-year only** |
| **Payment Options** | All Upfront, Partial Upfront, No Upfront | **No Upfront only** |
| **Configurability** | Fully configurable | Fixed (not configurable) |

This module enforces these constraints through Terraform validation. Attempting to set invalid values will fail at plan time:

```hcl
# ❌ This will FAIL validation:
database_sp_term = "THREE_YEAR"  # Error: must be ONE_YEAR

# ❌ This will FAIL validation:
database_sp_payment_option = "ALL_UPFRONT"  # Error: must be NO_UPFRONT

# ✅ This is correct (uses defaults):
enable_database_sp = true  # Automatically uses ONE_YEAR and NO_UPFRONT
```

## Supported Services

### Database Savings Plans Cover:

- **Amazon RDS** — Relational Database Service (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server)
- **Amazon Aurora** — MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database
- **Amazon DynamoDB** — NoSQL key-value and document database
- **Amazon ElastiCache (Valkey)** — In-memory caching service
- **Amazon DocumentDB** — MongoDB-compatible document database
- **Amazon Neptune** — Graph database service
- **Amazon Keyspaces** — Cassandra-compatible database service
- **Amazon Timestream** — Time series database service
- **AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)** — Database migration workloads

### Compute Savings Plans Cover:

- **Amazon EC2** — Elastic Compute Cloud instances (any family, size, region, OS, tenancy)
- **AWS Lambda** — Serverless compute
- **AWS Fargate** — Serverless containers for ECS and EKS

## Coverage Tracking

**Important:** Coverage for Compute and Database Savings Plans is tracked **separately**.

- **Separate Recommendations:** Scheduler fetches separate AWS recommendations for Compute and Database
- **Independent Targets:** Both SP types work toward the same `coverage_target_percent`, but separately
- **Independent Caps:** The `max_coverage_cap` is enforced independently for each SP type
- **Separate Email Sections:** Notifications show coverage percentages for each SP type separately

### Example Email Notification

When both SP types are enabled, emails will show:

```
=== Compute Savings Plans ===
Current Coverage: 85.2%
Target Coverage: 90.0%
Coverage Gap: 4.8%
Recommended Purchase: $5.50/hour (1-year and 3-year mix)

=== Database Savings Plans ===
Current Coverage: 72.3%
Target Coverage: 90.0%
Coverage Gap: 17.7%
Recommended Purchase: $8.25/hour (1-year, No Upfront)
```

This separation ensures that:
- Database coverage doesn't affect Compute SP purchasing decisions
- You can have different coverage levels for each workload type
- You can enable/disable each SP type independently without affecting the other

## Outputs

The module provides the following outputs for monitoring and integration:

### Queue Outputs
- `queue_url` — SQS queue URL for purchase intents

- `purchaser_lambda_name` — Purchaser Lambda function name

### Notification Outputs
- `sns_topic_arn` — SNS topic ARN for notifications

### Configuration Outputs
- `module_configuration` — Summary of current configuration
- `database_sp_configuration` — Database SP specific configuration with supported services and AWS constraints
- `lambda_environment_database_sp` — Database SP enable flag passed to Lambda functions

### Example Output Usage

```hcl
output "database_sp_status" {
  value = module.savings_plans.database_sp_configuration
}

# Output:
# {
#   enabled = true
#   term = "ONE_YEAR"
#   payment_option = "NO_UPFRONT"
#   supported_services = ["RDS", "Aurora", "DynamoDB", "ElastiCache (Valkey)", ...]
#   aws_constraints = {
#     term_fixed = "ONE_YEAR only"
#     payment_option_fixed = "NO_UPFRONT only"
#     configurable = false
#   }
# }
```

## Advanced Usage

### Database-Only Deployment

For organizations that only want Database Savings Plans automation:

```hcl
module "database_savings_plans" {
  source = "etiennechabert/sp-autopilot/aws"
  version = "~> 1.0"

  # Database SP only
  enable_compute_sp  = false
  enable_database_sp = true

  # Lower coverage target for databases (more conservative)
  coverage_target_percent = 70
  max_coverage_cap        = 80

  # Smaller purchase increments for DB workloads
  max_purchase_percent = 5

  # Notifications to database team
  notification_emails = ["database-ops@example.com"]

  dry_run = false
}
```

### Gradual Rollout Strategy

1. **Start with Dry Run (Week 1)**
   ```hcl
   dry_run = true
   enable_database_sp = true
   ```
   Review email recommendations without purchasing

2. **Enable Purchases with Conservative Limits (Week 2-4)**
   ```hcl
   dry_run = false
   coverage_target_percent = 70
   max_purchase_percent = 5
   ```
   Make small purchases, monitor results

3. **Increase Targets (Month 2+)**
   ```hcl
   coverage_target_percent = 90
   max_purchase_percent = 10
   ```
   Scale up as confidence grows

### Canceling Purchases

To cancel a scheduled purchase before it executes:

1. Navigate to AWS Console → SQS → Select queue `sp-autopilot-purchase-intents`
2. View messages in queue
3. Delete messages for purchases you want to cancel
4. Purchaser Lambda will skip deleted messages

**Note:** This must be done between scheduler run and purchaser run (during review window).

## Requirements

- **Terraform**: >= 1.0
- **AWS Provider**: >= 5.0
- **IAM Permissions**: Lambda functions require permissions for:
  - Cost Explorer API (GetSavingsPlansPurchaseRecommendation)
  - Savings Plans API (CreateSavingsPlan, DescribeSavingsPlans)
  - SQS (SendMessage, ReceiveMessage, DeleteMessage, PurgeQueue)
  - SNS (Publish)
  - CloudWatch Logs (for Lambda logging)
